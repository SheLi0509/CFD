# CFDJulia
Basic computational fluid dynamic codes in julia language. Currently including:

  1D and 2D convection equation
  1D and 2D diffusion equation
  1D and 2D Burger's equation
  
  Laplace and Poisson's equation added
  
All the numerical schemes are explicit in time (later implicit will be added).

For visualization you need to install PyPlot, DataFrames and Gadfly.
